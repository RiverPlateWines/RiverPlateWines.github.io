        <p>	The collection carried by River Plate Wines represents the history of Argentina and its traditional wines. Like most of the local population, the grapes currently grown and cultured in Argentina descend from Europe. The immigrants from Europe all entered through the port of Buenos Aires, situated on the River Plate delta: the equivalent of New York Cityâ€™s Ellis Island. With them, they brought their boisterous lifestyle, family-centered focus, and love of food and drink. Argentina was shaped by these immigrants much like the United States can see its imagine through the mosaic of peoples who have left their footprint in its history. Once in Argentina, immigrants from different regions co-mingled and collectively gave the country its image. Now Argentina is a vibrant place filled with loud, loving, and lively people, where wine is a central component of life. It is the center-piece of parties and the star of all dinners. The effect of European immigration on Argentinian wine cannot be understated. These new families brought their vines with them and reframed their beloved wines in the Argentinian context. In fact, the most notable variety from Mendoza, the biggest wine producing region in the country, is Malbec. It was brought over from France, but luckily avoided the same fate of the vines that remained in Europe and succumbed to a disease that took root in the French Malbecs. Now, the marvelous journey of these wines continues and the same River Plate that saw their arrival will allow their story to go on; this time as a port of exit. We are bringing the crown jewels of selected Argentinean boutique wineries to the American market. All wines from our collection share a history of adventure and transformation that is not limited to the vines that made the journey, but the people and love that settled them there.</p>
